Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.

Example1:
 Input: num = 2 (0b10)
 Output: [4, 1] ([0b100, 0b1])

Example2:
 Input: num = 1
 Output: [2, -1]

Note:
1 <= num <=Â 2147483647
If there is no next smallest or next largest number, output -1.
