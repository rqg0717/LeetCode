Given a string of length n consisting of digits [0-9], count the number of ways the given string can be split into prime numbers.
Since the answer can be large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7. 
Note: A partition that contains numbers with leading zeroes will be invalid and the initial string does not contain leading zeroes. 

For example the input string to be s = "3175", then this string can be split into 3 different ways as (31, 7,5), (3, 17, 5), (317,5) where each one of them contains only prime numbers.
